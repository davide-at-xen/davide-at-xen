# Landing page for Xen Quantum

A simple temporary landing page for Xen Quantum.


# TODOs
- [ ] Put some space between the page edge and the footer
- [ ] Due to iphones having shitty resolutions, I need to move the footer text out of the actual tag put a minimum distance form the body
- [ ] The image size is bounded by a value in pixels at the moment. I want it to be bounded by the size of the div containing the company name.
- [ ] In the contancts page, move the text more on the center right of the page
- [ ] Add some space between the separation line and the "coming soon" text. At the moment the space is set by the line-height and an empty paragraph, which is a sumoptimal solution
